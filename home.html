    <p>The band started back in 2002, as an instrumental only group. Alex and Matt, who were close friends 
      and neighbours at the time, teamed up with their pal Andy to form the group. After the addition of 
      Jamie, the Arctic Monkeys played their first official gig in 2003 and soon began recording demo tracks 
      the first of which would be called 'Beneath the Boardwalk'<br>
